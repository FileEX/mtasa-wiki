The MTA **Lua API** is an extensive ecosystem built on an extended version of [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/), offering a wide array of functions and systems to enhance and customize gameplay. Whether you're creating game modes, modifying existing ones, or adding new features, the **Lua API** gives you full control over the game environment.

This API includes a powerful [event system](/events), a robust [element system](/Element) for interacting with in-game objects, and a vast collection of [functions](/functions) to manage game logic, networking, and more.
