# Contributing to wiki.multitheftauto.com

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the MTA:SA Lua API documentation!

We are currently restructuring and modernizing how the API is documented in this repository. Please follow the priorities below when contributing.

## ðŸ“š Philosophy & Objective

The goal of this new documentation system is to provide a clean, structured, and authoritative reference for the **MTA:SA Lua API and core engine features only**.

This repository is not intended to serve as a general-purpose wiki or community hub. It will only host official documentation related to:
- Built-in Lua functions
- Events
- Elements and element types
- Data structures and native MTA functionality

We are deliberately excluding community-created content, such as:
- Third-party resources (e.g. DGS, scoreboard, etc.)
- Tutorials, guides, or scripting best practices
- Pages about servers, mods, or other fan-made projects

These kinds of content are valuable to the community, but they will be organized and maintained elsewhere, outside this repository, in a more suitable space (e.g. community wiki, forums, or Discord).

By keeping this documentation focused and consistent, we aim to create a high-quality, structured, and future-proof source of truth for all MTA:SA development.

## ðŸ¥‡ Priority 1: Finish the Lua API Structure

Help us refine and complete the YAML schema definitions for all API types:
- `functions/`
- `events/`
- `elements/`

The goal is to have a complete **YAML schema** for each API type (function, event, element), with all the necessary information (syntax, notes, return values, code examples, etc.), **ready for automatic generation of documentation pages**. Ensure that the YAML files are well-structured and follow the conventions used in the existing files.

## ðŸ¥ˆ Priority 2: Finish the Site UI and UX

Ensure the site properly renders:
- Function pages
- Event pages
- Element pages
- Code examples and cross-references
- Additional articles

Report issues or inconsistencies in the frontend rendering or contribute layout/fix improvements via pull request.

You may also submit additional site improvements, such as a bookmarks system or other features that enhance user experience.

## ðŸ¥‰ Later Phase: Port Legacy Wiki Content

Once the structure and display are complete, weâ€™ll begin porting all legacy wiki documentation into YAML format.

This phase is not the current focus, but feel free to experiment or prepare tools/scripts to assist with this process.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork (creates a local copy)
3. To work on a contribution, create a new branch for your changes (based on `main`)
4. Make your changes and commit them with a clear message (e.g. `Fix code example display for function pages`)
