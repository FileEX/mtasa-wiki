# Welcome to the New Multi Theft Auto: Wiki

We are excited to introduce the **new Multi Theft Auto (MTA)** Wiki, a fresh and improved resource for developers, scripters, and players alike! The MTA community thrives on collaboration, and this upcoming version of the Wiki aims to make contributing, learning, and exploring as seamless as possible.

This Wiki is being created from scratch, dynamically generated with data from the [official **mtasa-wiki** GitHub repository](https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-wiki). It will provide up-to-date information on **functions, events, elements, articles, and more**. Whether youâ€™re a newcomer or a veteran, the new Wiki is designed to support your journey in creating awesome experiences with MTA.

## Key Features

These are some of the new features you can expect from the new Wiki:

- **Dynamic Content**: The new Wiki uses data sourced directly from the GitHub repository, ensuring that any updates to functions, events, or documentation are instantly reflected.

- **True to Code**: The Wiki is designed to be a true reflection of the MTA scripting environment, with accurate and detailed information on the extensive Lua scripting API.
  
- **Improved Search**: Find what you need faster with an upgraded search system that helps you locate the exact functions, events, or articles youâ€™re looking for.

- **Modern Interface**: A clean, user-friendly design makes it easier than ever to browse and contribute to the Wiki.

- **Developer-First Approach**: Resources are organized to prioritize developer needs, with clear and concise documentation with rich and practical examples.

## Why a New Wiki?

The MTA community has been built on a foundation of collaboration and open sharing of knowledge. The new Wiki represents a significant step forward in maintaining that legacy by leveraging automation and community-driven content, stepping away from the previously used MediaWiki technology. By syncing directly with GitHub, the Wiki becomes a **reliable and centralized hub** for learning and contribution.

Since the Wiki is still under development, this **Preview** version offers a glimpse into the future of MTA documentation. Your feedback, suggestions, and contributions are invaluable in shaping it into the best resource for the community.
